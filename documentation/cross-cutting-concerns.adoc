== Cross-cutting Concerns

In this application we consider cross-cutting-concerns to be functionality which is used in most of the flows.
Thus, we consider cross-cutting-concerns to be part of any flow, unless stated otherwise.
This chapter describes how cross-cutting concerns are addressed in this application.
Examples for cross-cutting concerns are:

* Authentication
* Logging
* Attribute-based Access Control

=== Authentication

Users have to be authenticated in order to be able to execute useful functionality.
Only a limited set of functionality, such as the authentication itself, does not require authentication.
